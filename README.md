I am continually learning and striving to transition from a manual tester to an automation engineer. With over 14 years of experience in manual testing, I’ve faced increasing challenges in finding work in Poland since 2023, as manual testers are often undervalued. Despite searching for over a year, I remain determined to upskill and build a career in automation testing. This repository is a significant milestone in my journey, showcasing my progress and dedication to mastering automation frameworks.


# SeleniumWebDriver_Scripts
# I’ve written several scripts in Python using Selenium, covering basic functions, and over time, increasingly complex ones will be added.

# This is my sandbox environment where I’m learning, and I strive to document my scripts clearly so that their purpose is easily understood. 
# Perhaps it might be helpful for you as well!
